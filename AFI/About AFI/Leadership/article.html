            the special needs of members of the United States military. We
            currently assist members with their insurance needs for their
            personal property, homes, autos and much more.
          </p>

            AFI was originally formed and continues to be led by former military
            leaders who understand the unique challenges that come with military
            service. We proudly serve active, retired and former military
            personnel, their families, and civilian Department of Defense
            employees.
