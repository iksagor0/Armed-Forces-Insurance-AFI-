                <h1>Life Insurance</h1>
                <p>
                  Life insurance should be an essential part of the financial
                  plan for every family. Protect your family from the lost
                  income, medical bills, and funeral expenses that can occur
                  with an unexpected death from illness or accident. In addition
                  to providing a lifeline during a time of loss, life insurance
                  can help ensure that your dreams of college education, magical
                  weddings, and a comfortable retirement can still be provided
                  for as planned.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Armed Forces Insurance has teamed up with AFBA to provide
                  access to life insurance protection you and your family can
                  count on. An AFBA member benefit funded by life insurance
                  underwritten by 5Star Life Insurance Company offers features
                  suited to the military family.

                <p>
                  Coverage from $50,000 to $400,000. Based on your individual
                  situation, you decide how much coverage is right for you and
                  your family.

                  to age 60 for $100,000 for military members. For spouses, no
                  medical exam under age 40 up to $250,000 and under age 50 up

                  dependent upon the answers to the health questions.

                <p>
                  Full coverage after retirement or separation. As long as

                  70th birthday, coverage terminates on coverage anniversary
                  date.) There are no occupation restrictions, so regardless of
                  what you do after the military or any health issues that may
                  develop in the future, you're covered.
