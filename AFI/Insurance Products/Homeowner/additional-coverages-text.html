              <h6>Business Property</h6>
              <p>
                You take pride in your buildings, equipment, stock and supplies.
                No no matter your size, location or industry, Armed Forces
                Business Insurance provides flexible insurance solutions.
              </p>
              <h6>Business Liability</h6>
              <p>
                A growing business can have lots of moving parts. Accidents can
                happen on site and off, affect employees and customers, and
                leave your business responsible no matter how careful you are.
                Liability insurance can help cover attorney fees, medical
                expenses, and other damages in the event of a liability
                judgement.
              </p>
              <h6>Business Vehicles</h6>
              <p>
                More than 16,000 traffic accidents happen per day. Whether you
                use your own car, have a fleet, or rely on employee vehicles to
                get the job done, the veterans and military business insurance
                specialists at Armed Forces Insurance can find the protection
                you need to help keep your business moving forward.
              </p>
              <h6>Worker’s Compensation</h6>
              <p>
                Workers’ Compensation insurance covers medical costs and a
                portion of lost wages for an employee who becomes injured or ill
                on the job, but it also protects companies from being sued by
                employees for workplace conditions that can cause an injury or
                illness. Required in nearly every state, Workers’ Compensation
                laws are designed to ensure payment on behalf of employers for
                the cost of injuries or occupational diseases.
              </p>
              <h6>Builders’ Risk</h6>
              <p>
                No matter how large or small your construction or renovation
                project, you need insurance protection that goes beyond
                construction materials. A Builder’s Risk Policy protects your
                investment, which means it will help replace your income as well
                as your expenses. You need a flexible agent like Armed Forces
                Insurance who realizes that the risk continually changes with
                every phase – from the hole in the ground right up until your
                building or home is completed.
