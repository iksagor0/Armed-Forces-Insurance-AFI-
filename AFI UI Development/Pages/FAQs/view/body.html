                                                    vehicle. On some policies and in some states, you have 14 days to
                                                    add the vehicle to your policy. The vehicle will be added to your
                                                    policy effective the date of purchase. The newly acquired vehicle

                                                    coverage. If you have at least one auto insured with full coverage,
                                                    then the new car will also receive full coverage.</p>

                                                <p>The selection of a contractor is your choice. Please review the

                                                    contactor, please have your contractor provide a line-item detailed

                                                    and examine for approval any change in scope or estimated charges
                                                    for repairs. In certain instances, it may be necessary to have the

                                                    independent adjuster will compare your contractor's line item
                                                    estimate to his line item estimate to make certain the damages are

                                                    your area. If needed, the independent adjuster will work with your
                                                    contractor to reach an agreement on the repairs. However, if your

                                                    Forces Insurance will make settlement based on the independent
